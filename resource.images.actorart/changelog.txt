v0.0.5:
- On @"ronie"'s recommendation changed zip name and addon.xml addon id from "resource.images.actorpngs" to "resource.images.actorart", as well the type from "actorpngs" to "actorart" - that means, if you have installed the addon before, it is not an update but a new installation, and please adjust the code line in skin. I hope these are the last changes that have a direct impact. I'm new to this stuff.
